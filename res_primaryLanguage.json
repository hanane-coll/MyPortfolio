      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Yacoubi Hanane, 21 years old. I'm a computer science student at ENSAH. I'm interested in the field because it allows me to apply my math, science, and programming knowledge to solve exciting and valuable problems. Objectively, I'm placing myself somewhere around high-junior / low-mid dev, so I still have a long way to go. I love teaching myself new things. I started with programming in high school and college, then learned about web development, data structures, analysis of algorithms and many more. Now that i've gotten a taste of teaching myself, I can't stop. It's advantageous, and i hope to learn more about the field as my career progresses.",
